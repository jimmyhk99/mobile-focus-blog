<p>On July 19 and 20, 2014, the DEG mobile team joined 150 other professionals in a hackathon called Hack Midwest in Overland Park, KS. The hackathon consisted of 25 teams mixed between university students, professional designers, and experienced developers who came together to create mobile apps, web sites, and other applications in 24 hours.</p>

<p>Four of us (Dan Morris, Jonathan Willis, Sree Kakarla, and myself) from DEG participated in the hackathon. After our team pre-match meeting, we decided to challenge ourselves with building a real-time, 2-D Ninja fighting mobile game in 24 hours. The game was designed to accept two players/ninjas fighting each other by throwing ninja stars. The player uses the mobile app to join a game battle and use hand gestures to control his/her ninja and attack opponents by throwing ninja stars. All gameplay is displayed on a website in real-time.</p>

<p>Our goals of this hackathon were to challenge ourselves with a new set of technologies we rarely used before, to treat it as a team-building exercise, and have a fun at the same time.</p>
